**Assignment 1**
Building a responsive single-page website

The following breakpoints are considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser displays a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. The tablet view appears only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. The mobile view appears only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.

The site is straightforward. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (using media queries )

**Layout:**

-In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections takes up an equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section becomes wider or narrower.

-In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections are in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section is in the second row and takes up the entire row by itself.

-In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section takes up the entire row.

**Section title region:** Each section has a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet, or mobile).
